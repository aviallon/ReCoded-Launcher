Erdnaxe's Launcher
================

Based on SkCraft's Launcher. Customised to put my own modpacks inside, with a french translation.

## Compiling

In your command prompt or terminal, run:

	./gradlew clean build

If you are on Windows:

	gradlew clean build

If you wish to import the project into an IDE, you must add support for Project Lombok (IntelliJ IDEA users: also enable annotation processing in compiler settings).

## License

The launcher is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3.
